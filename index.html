    Sleep plays an important role for humans and work on automated sleep staging using machines has 
    important implications. Most of the current state-of-the-art approaches only consider one aspect 
    of the spatial or temporal characteristics of the brain during sleep, resulting in inadequate modelling 
    of the spatio-temporal characteristics of the brain's sleep process. A few works have taken into account 
    the spatio-temporal characteristics of the brain, however, these works lack representation of the 
    spatial-temporal relationships in the brain, resulting in models that are somewhat less interpretable.

The Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Transformer (BSTT) model proposed in this paper introduces a relational 
    inference method that can automatically infer the spatio-temporal relationships in the brain during 
    sleep and generate spatio-temporal relationship inference maps to serve spatio-temporal feature extraction. 
    The model also adopts an advanced Transformer architecture to capture spatio-temporal features, which 
    further enhances the effectiveness of the model. Extensive experiments have shown that our model achieves 
    the most advanced results available, while having a degree of interpretability.

    We used eight baseline methods for comparison with our methodology, as follows:
    <table width="100%" style="margin: 20pt 0; text-align: center;">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="./fig/baseline.png" width="90%"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    Compared to other baseline methods, BSTT achieved the best performance on both datasets. Specifically, MCNN and MMCNN utilise CNN models to automatically extract sleep features, while RNN-based methods such as DeepSleepNet and 
    TinySleepNet focus on the temporal context in sleep data and model multi-level temporal features during sleep for sleep staging. In addition, GraphSleepNet and ST-Transformer simultaneously modelled the spatial-temporal relationships during sleep with 
    satisfactory results. However, GraphSleepNet and ST-Transformer cannot adequately reason about the spatial-temporal relationship, which limits the classification performance to a certain extent. 
    Our Bayesian ST-Transformer uses a multi-headed Bayesian relational inference component to reason about spatial-temporal relationships in order to better model spatial and temporal relationships. As a result, the proposed model achieves the best classification performance on different datasets.
